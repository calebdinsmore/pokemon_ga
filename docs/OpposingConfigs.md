#Opposing Team Configs

###Motivation
Our motivation in creating these configurations is to thoroughly challenge the individuals in our population.

####All types
We wanted every type in Pokemon to be represented in the opposing team configurations. There are **18** types in total. With six-pokemon teams, this allowed us to make 3 teams that in total composed all 18 possible types.

Lucky for us, there's a Pokemon in the uber tier list that is capable of being any of the 18 types at a given time.

####Arceus
- Combination of the prefix "arch-", which signifies authority or power, and "deus", literally meaning "god."
